I'm Mohit Choudhary. I'm a software developer, recently transitioned more towards operations side. I strongly believe in devops (development & operations should go hand in hand), more recently devsecops. In this blog, I try to keep up to date any interesting thing I work on or new challenges that I face.

Currently I'm working as Lead Devops Engineer at
[Scripbox](https://scripbox.com).

- I've done my graduation from NIT surat in Computer Engineering.
- I worked as a software developer in telecom giant Amdocs, where we had to
  customize legacy ordering management system for client AT&T enterprise. I
learned a great deal by working on legacy application.

I'm fascinated a lot by digital computers & am always interested to look under
hood of how things work.

Apart from computers, I love swimming, reading, listening & playing music on my
flute in my spare time.
